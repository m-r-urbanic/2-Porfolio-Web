# 2-Portfolio-Web

## Description

This project is a personal portfolio of the projects and assignments I create through the bootcamp. This webpage contains a profile picture and contact information, the project link sections will lead to blank webpages initially and will be updated as I progress through the course.

This is showcasing my understanding of HTML and CSS in order to make a basic webpage.
